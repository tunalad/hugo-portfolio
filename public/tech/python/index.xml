      <description>NeFT (New From Template) is a simple command-line tool that allows you to create new files using pre-made templates.
I developed this tool during my transition to a more CLI based workflow when I found myself missing the convenience of the Create New option in GUI file managers.
1. Usage NeFT offers various options, allowing you to customize your file creation experience. You can choose to draw icons, display the full file path, and sort files in the menu based on your preferences.</description>

      <description>PDF-splitter is a user-friendly GUI tool designed to extract pages from a PDF document. GUI part was done via Qt, so (in theory) it should work on all systems
Originally developed as a project for the SCS (Specialized Computer Systems) course, it continues to receive occasional updates.
1. Usage The process is straightforward: locate a document and load it. Upon loading, each page of the document is converted into an image (as depicted above).</description>

For example, inputing python and selecting your seniority (or none), it will look through all the ads and fetch the tags from them.
After that, it will create a graph with the count of found items.

      <description>I don&amp;rsquo;t have any screenshots for this app because I don&amp;rsquo;t have Android Studio installed. Yes, I could install it, but the tool is massive and I have no interest in writing Android apps. Android Studio is also a massive resources hog, so I&amp;rsquo;d prefert to not have it on my system.
This post exists for the future me to update with the app&amp;rsquo;s explanation and images. How far in the future?</description>
