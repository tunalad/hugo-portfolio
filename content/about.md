## About this website

Purpose of this website is to be like a slightly expanded resume, showcasing my projects & approach on how I go about making stuff.

Another plan for this site is to have like a "blog" section. It won't necessarily be like actual blogging, but some minor Linux setting up stuff, or something like cheatsheets for some tools that I use.

As for the technical stuff about the website, it was made with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and a microscopic amount of JavaScript.

## Technical skills

For this section, I've split my technical skills in three groups. These reflect my **confidence level**, rather than my actual skill with technology.
So it doesn't mean that my skills with Python or JavaScript are advanced, it just means that I'm pretty confident with it and I believe that I can get some job done pretty quickly.

### Advanced

{{< tech-skills "lv-adv" >}}
Linux
Python

### Intermediate

{{< tech-skills "lv-mid" >}}

Lua
Git
SQL
Java
{{</tech-skills>}}

### Basic

{{< tech-skills "lv-bas" >}}

## Younger me

As stated on the home page, I'm just a dude that likes to make stuff. I've got my first computer at the age of 6 (or 7, I don't remember exactly), constantly playing games on it pretty much. Of course, that lead me to start making my own games and mods for games. Around 12 or 13 years of age I started learning English properly, which helped a lot with finding proper resources. That's about when I started coding my own stuff.

I sadly haven't archived my older projects, but ones that I remember being "good" were a [Slender](https://www.indiedb.com/games/slender-the-eight-pages) game clone and 3D rage platformer game, both made in Unity. There were a couple of 2D platformer games too, but I was pretty bad at finishing my projects back then so there were like 2-3 test levels at most. There weren't many non-gaming projects that I was making, but one that I do very well remember was a Dicord bot written in C#.

Now games are't just coding, it's also pretty graphics and good sound design. This later down the line led me to start [doing music and art](https://tunalad.tumblr.com/) (primarily music though).

## Web development

My interest in web development sparked during my university years. Initially, I was skeptical due to the prevalence of slow and bloated websites. It was in my 5th semester, while taking a web programming course, that I began to change my mind. I found myself genuinely enjoying the process of creating web applications. It struck me that not only were they fun to develop, but they also represented the cleanest and most versatile path to building cross-platform applications.

Ever since then I started to become a lot more open about tech nologies. Instead of seeing something and saying "it sounds bad, that's not for me", I instead say "I mean it doesn't sound that nice, but let's try it out anyway!". One of the technologies that I got into that way is Blender. Although I don't make stuff in Blender that often anymore, I do find creating with it very enjoyable (except when I have to render a single image on my old laptop and proceeds to take about an hour).

## Linux & minimalism

My Linux journey kicked off when I made the shift to Arch. Windows was slowing down my laptop, so I looked for a lighter alternative. Arch gave me the freedom to build a minimal OS, without all the unnecessary [bloatware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_bloat). Sometimes, when I needed an app, I'd just write it myself, letting me keep the app as minimal as possible. This journey introduced me to the [suckless philosophy](https://suckless.org/philosophy/), emphasizing simplicity and minimalism in software design. It is definitely something that I agree with, but I don't go as hard as they do when writing my tools.
