I don't have any screenshots for this app because I don't have Android Studio installed. Yes, I could install it, but the tool is massive and I have no interest in writing Android apps. Android Studio is also a massive resources hog, so I'd prefert to not have it on my system. 

This post exists for the future me to update with the app's explanation and images. How far in the future? No clue.
