# Novica's website

{{< small "Full Stack Developer" >}}

Hey there, welcome to my website! I'm just a dude that likes to make stuff that does some stuff. You can check out stuff that I made on the [projects page](). And if you're interested in my "history" of development, check out the [about page]().

Oh yeah, I'm also an artist! This page will focus only on the tech related stuff, so for the artistry stuff you can go [here](https://tunalad.indie.af/) (page might be still under construction, so maybe check out my [tumblr](https://tunalad.tumblr.com/) instead).
