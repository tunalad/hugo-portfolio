# Hello, I'm Novica

{{< small "Full Stack Developer" >}}

Purpose of this website is to be like slightly expanded resume, showcasing my projects and mentioning a little bit about myself.

Another plan for this site is to have like a "blogging" section. It won't necessarily be like actual blogging, but some minor Linux setting up or something like cheatsheets for some programming tools.
